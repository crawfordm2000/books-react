This is my first project using the React library. It is a small project, limited in its use of state, props, routes, and components. This was intentional because I wanted to create a functional app that works as it was designed and to build off this experience before attempting more ambitious projects in the future. This app uses the Google Books API to return queries entered into the search field. Currently, the app will return ten results no matter what is searched. 


User Instructions:
1) In the search bar, type the name of an author or the title of a book you're looking for.
2) Once results have been rendered, you can click on the image of the book to be taken the the Google Books preview page.
3) You can read a sample or purchase this book from this location.
4) Inside of a bookcard, you can click the 'add to shelf' button to add it to your bookshelf.
5) Next to the search bar, you can click the 'bookshelf' button to see the books you've saved for later perusal.
6) Books in your Bookshelf view can be removed from the view by pressing the 'remove' button.
